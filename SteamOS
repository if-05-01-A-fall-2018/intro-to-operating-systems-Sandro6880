Report on Steam-OS!

Steam-OS is a Debian based Linux operating System developed by Valve.
It was primarily designed to play games on besides the PC without the use of mouse and keyboard. (There is a Controller for the System).
You are able to stream games abroad from your PC "(regardless of the OS!)" to your TV.
It is also possible to edit the source code of Steam-OS by the users,since the system is open source.
There aren't many build in functions(file manager,image viewer)by default, but you are able to install other softwares
with the use of GNOME. There are two ways to install the OS to your computer.(Automated Installation method and the Expert method(more customizable)).
OEM's are allowed to manufacture Steam Machines with Steam-OS on it and are allowed to use it for commercials because of Valves license.(given out to chosen OEM's)
Users should not consider Steam-OS as a replacement for their desktop operating system. Steam-OS is being designed and optimized for the living room experience.
